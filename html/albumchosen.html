      <h1> About Chosen </h1>
<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_(EP)-->
      <p>Rush! is the third studio album by Italian rock band M책neskin, released on 20 January 2023 through Epic
          Records. It was preceded by the singles "Mammamia", "Supermodel", "The Loneliest", and "Gossip", with
          "Baby Said" following on 3 March 2023. In support of the album and its predecessor Teatro d'ira: Vol.
          I (2021), the band is embarking on the Loud Kids Tour and the Rush! World Tour throughout 2022 and
          2023. A reissue titled Rush! (Are U Coming?) was released on 10 November 2023, supported by the
          single "Honey (Are U Coming?)"</p>

      <p>M책neskin recorded "probably 50" songs for the album, which they recorded in part in Los Angeles with
          producer Max Martin. The band revealed that they had been working on their "debut international
          album" with Martin and the MXM and Wolf Cousins team, including Savan Kotecha and Mattman & Robin,
          extensively after meeting them the previous year. The single "Supermodel", which was worked on with
          Martin and Rami Yacoub, was premiered live during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2022.
          The band later teased a song on the album called "Gasoline", written in support of Ukraine after the
          2022 Russian invasion, also made by the team. They were also influenced during the writing and
          recording process after listening to Radiohead, with bassist Victoria De Angelis stating that M책neskin
          had "tried to experiment a bit more with [their] sound. We listened to a lot of Radiohead where they
          work a lot with pedals." Frontman Damiano David said: "I think that the inspiration we got from
          Radiohead was to be very focused on creating a very specific world for each song. It's something they do
          very, very well so we tried to create these amazing atmospheres. They really create an image of what
          you're listening to, and that gave us inspiration."</p>
