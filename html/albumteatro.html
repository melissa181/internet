      <h1> About Teatro D'ira Vol.I </h1>

      <!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_d%27ira:_Vol._I-->
      <p>Teatro d'ira: Vol. I is the second studio album by Italian rock band M책neskin. It was released on 19 March
        2021 through RCA and Sony. It includes the singles "Vent'anni" and the Sanremo and Eurovision-winning "Zitti e
        buoni", as well as the songs "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and "Coraline".
        Following M책neskin's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with "Zitti e buoni", the album started
        appearing on weekly charts across Europe. It peaked at number one on the Italian albums chart, and was certified
        quintuple platinum by FIMI. It also reached number one on the Finnish, Lithuanian, and Swedish album charts and
        reached the top ten of the charts in fourteen other territories. It has since received three other gold music
        certifications in three other countries.</p>

      <p>From late 2019 until spring 2020, the band lived in London where they refined their playing skills, music style
        and worked on new material. This is the first part of a larger recording project entirely written by
        the four members of the group. Unlike the previous album Il ballo della vita (2018), the album was recorded
        entirely live in order to recreate the same atmosphere that M책neskin felt during the concerts held in previous
        years and can be heard in 1970s bootleg recordings.
        According to the band, the project's title "Teatro d'ira" ("theatre of wrath") and meaning are of
        "cathartic anger aimed at oppressions and oppressors, which leads to venting and rebelling against everything
        that makes you feel wrong and which, as a result, leads to a rebirth and change. We wanted to place this very
        powerful force in a context, that of the theater, which in the common imagination is perceived as elegant and
        calm. We like this antithesis: a contrast that lives when the curtain opens and, instead of a show or a ballet,
        we find ourselves catapulted into this explosion of energy. Theatre is a metaphor to represent art, the place
        where this powerful impulse generates something artistic and positive."
        This concept was reiterated by the group during the presentation of the album: "Each piece was composed entirely
        by us, from the first to the last note. It will be a record out of the canons, we are aware of it but we screwed
        it up to give you the most sincere and real version of ourselves, because the music is the only thing that
        matters, and this time it will be only her to speak. For now, make yourself comfortable in the armchairs, the
        Theatre of Wrath is about to raise its curtain."
        Unlike the previous album which was inspired by their muse "Marlena", this album was inspired by them. Album
        lyrics are dealing with various topics related to the young generation. With "Vent'anni" and "Zitti e buoni"
        being social manifestos about individuality, others like "I Wanna Be Your Slave" talk about duality in love
        relationships, and "La paura del buio" about people who fear both the unknown and other people for being
        different</p>
